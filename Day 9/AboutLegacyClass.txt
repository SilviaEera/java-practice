Legacy Class :  Legacy Class was developed by java before introducing java collection framework.

                Enumerator was used in Legacy class just like how Iterator is used in collection framework.

                All legacy classes were synchronized. Where the classes of collection framework are not synchronized.

                So multi-threading was not allowed in legacy classes.

                Legacy class is now not in use but we still use Vector and Stack class sometimes.
