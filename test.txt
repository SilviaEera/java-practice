Super s = new Sub();

super class reference and sub-class object 

this is dynamic method dispatch for achieving runtime polymorphism

we  can use super class reference to access the overridden methods in sub-class.

 using the new keyword the object is created in heap memory dynamically. 

before runtime we the program cannot decide which method to call, this is how this process achieves runtime polymorphism.

==============================

through IS-A relationship we promote data reusability . (child extends parent : child is a parent)

through Has-A relationship we promote data navigation and communication. (car has a engine)



In Has-A relationship there is a target object and a dependent object.

Injecting the dependent object into the target object is known as data injection.

data injection can be achieved through 
					- constructor injection
					- setter injection





1  >>>>>> ONE TO ONE RELATIONSHIP

in a one to one relationship one instance of an entity (class) is mapped to just one instance of another entity.

example : A employee has only one salary account;



2 >>>>>> ONE TO MANY RELATIONSHIP

in a one to many relationship one instance of an entity is mapped to multiple instances of another entity.

example : one department has multiple students.
