A supar class referance can hold an object of a sub-class. 

It can only call the methods that are defined inside the supar clas. 

If a method of supar class is overrided inside the sub-class then the overrided method will be called, as methods are called depending on the object not referance.

Dynamic Method Dispatch ====> A supar class referance holding an object of a sub-class and calling the overrided method inside the sub-class.
                        ====> It's known as runtime polymorphism. 

Dispatch here means calling a method. 

Dynamically calling a method.

Object will be created dynamically in *Heap* memory at runtime of the program. Before that we can not decide which object will be created. Thus the name dynamic method dispatch and reason it is called runtime polymorphism.

new means it ( the object ) is dynamically created inside the heap memory at runtime.
