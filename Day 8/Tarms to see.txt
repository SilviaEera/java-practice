string vs string builder vs string buffer

string is immutable. can not change a string after  creation, changing it will result to a new string objece.

string buffer is mutable. can add string or characters to any index of a string buffer class object. 
the string length inside a string buffer can be less than or equal to the capacity of the string buffer.


String buffer is thread safe. as it is thread safe its slower.

string buffer methods are synchronized so no two threads can access the methods of string buffer at the same time.


threads can hold and use the referance of a string buffer object but they are not allowed inside a method.

by default the capacity of string buffer is 16


//////////////////////////////////////////////////


Stirng builder is the same as String buffer but it is not thread safe. As it is not thread safe, its a bit faster than string buffer.

As it is not thread safe, more than one thread can enter the string builder and use the methods.

this can cause data loss. 




//////////////////////////////////////////////////

so when we need mutable string and only one thread will be using it we can go for string builder.

when multiple threads needs to access the string we can use the string buffer class for its thread safty.
