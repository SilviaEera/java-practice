used for defining anonymous functions/methods.

if an interface has a single abstract method then its called a funtional interface. 

they use the annotation @FunctionalInterface

java program interact with recources by transfering data.

stream is a flow of data.

buffer is a memory object or a temporary spot where chunk of data is stored when being transferd from one place from another. 

data is stored in buffer then passed to another device / object slowly.

buffer transfers small amount of data at a time.




when data is transferd, it is sent as bytes by bytes. whole data is not sent altogather .



java input/output strams ===============> 
                                        
                                        1. Byte stream
                                            -> Input stream 
                                            -> Output stream
                                            
                                             
                                        2. Character stream
                                            -> Reader class
                                            -> Writer class
